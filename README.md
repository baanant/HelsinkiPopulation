Known issues:
Hovering the chart causes weird behavior (flickering and the data changes for a while).
Gulp minimization does not work, so for now the app utilizes normal .js and .css files.
JSon parsing could be more sophisticated.
Some rendering problems.
In real life app dev.helsinki.fi API would have been called (in most of the cases) directly from AngularJS.
Exception handling is missing.
Unit testing is missing.
Some cleaning should be done.
